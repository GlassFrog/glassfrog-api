The Glassfrog API
====================


Making a request
----------------

All URLs start with `https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/api`. **SSL only**.


No JSON, just XML
-----------------

We only support XML for serialization of data.  All API URLs end in .xml to indicate that they accept and return XML.
