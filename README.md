The Glassfrog API
====================


Making a request
----------------

All URLs start with `https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/api`. **SSL only**.

The full request path is formed by appending the method path to this address, e.g. `https://glassfrog.holacracy.org/api/lead_links.xml`


No JSON, just XML
-----------------

We only support XML for serialization of data.  All API URLs end in .xml to indicate that they return XML.
